with interchangeable
parts had been in the minds of many
men for a long time. Several attempts had been made
to translate this conception into a reality. Success
crowned the efforts of those working near Boston,
Massachusetts, in the 1850&#8217;s. The work done there
formed the basis on which American watch making
grew to such a point that by the 1870&#8217;s watches of
domestic manufacture had captured nearly all the
home market and were reaching out and capturing
foreign markets as well. In spite of this great achievement
there remained a large untapped potential
market for a watch which would combine the virtues
of close time keeping and a lower selling price.
Only a radical departure in design could achieve this.
Rivalry between the several existing companies had
already produced an irreducible minimum price on
watches of conventional design.
</p>
<p>
The great obstacle to close rate in a modestly priced
watch is the balance wheel. This wheel requires
careful adjustment for temperature error and for
poise. Of these two disturbing factors poise is the
most annoying to the owner because lack of it makes
the watch a very erratic timekeeper. A watch in
which the parts are not poised is subject to a different
rate for every position it is placed in. This position
error, as it is called, can and often does cause a most
erratic and unpredictable rate. Abraham-Louis
Breguet, the celebrated Swiss-French horologist of
Paris is credited with the invention, in 1801,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of his
tourbillon, a clever way to circumvent this error.

<p>
His solution was to mount the escapement in a
frame or &#8220;chariot&#8221; which revolved, usually once a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
minute, so that with each revolution all possible positions
were passed through (fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_1">1</a>). This gave the
watch an average rate which was constant except for
variations within the period of revolution of the
chariot. Only a very skillful workman could, however,
work with the delicacy necessary to produce such a
mechanism. The result was that few were made and
these were so expensive that it continued to be
more practical to poise the parts in a conventional
movement. The idea of revolving the entire train of
a watch, including the escapement, seems to have
evolved surprisingly slowly from Breguet&#8217;s basic
invention of the revolving escapement. In constructing
a watch wherein the entire train revolves, no such
delicate or precise workmanship is required as in the
tourbillon. Due to the longer train of gears involved
the period of revolution is much slower. Position
errors average out as certainly if not as frequently.

<h2>The Invention</h2>

</div>

<p>
The patent model of Jason R. Hopkins&#8217; revolving
watch, now in the U.&nbsp;S. National Museum,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was not
the first in which the entire train revolved but it was
a very novel conception intended to reduce greatly
the number of parts usually associated with any
watch. This may be seen from figures <a href="#LN_FIGURE_2">2</a>
and <a href="#LN_FIGURE_3">3</a>, where
everything shown inside the ring gear revolves slowly
as the main spring runs down. This spring is prevented
from running down at its own speed by the
train pinion seen in mesh with the ring gear. Through
this pinion motion is imparted to the escape wheel and
balance, where the rate of the watch is controlled.
The balance, being planted at the center of revolution,
travels around its own axis, as in the tourbillon,
at the speed with which the entire train revolves
around the barrel arbor. This arbor turns only
during winding. No dial or dial gearing is shown in
the patent or exists in the patent model. The patent
merely says, casually, &#8220;By means of dial wheels the
motion of the barrel may be communicated to hands
and the time indicated in the usual manner.&#8221; No
fine finish or jeweling has been lavished on the
model, the only jewels present being in the balance
cock which was utilized as it came from its original
watch with only minor modification to the shape of
its foot. Apparently the balance wheel itself is also
a relic of the same or a similar conventional watch.
There is no jeweling in the escapement or on the
other end of the balance staff. In spite of this the
model runs very actively and will overbank if wound up
very far. The beat of the escapement is two per
second and the movement revolves once in 20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
There are two great faults in the model. First is
the lack of an adequate bearing for the barrel to
turn on. There is only one very short bearing a long
way removed from the point of engagement between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
the pinion and internal gear, and no adequate support
is given the barrel, with the result that it tends
to deflect from the ideal or true position and to bind.
This condition is aggravated by the fact that the ring
gear was made by cutting its teeth on an angle to
the axis around which it is to revolve, using only a
saw of appropriate width. The teeth were then
rounded-up to form by hand in a separate operation
which by its very nature means that the teeth are
not exactly alike. This lack of uniformity of the ring
gear coupled with an entirely inadequate bearing for
the barrel contributes to rather erratic transfer of
power. These irregular teeth would not, of course,
be a factor in factory-made watches where suitable
machinery would be available for the work.

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto;width: 600px;'>
Figure 2.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Patent Drawing of the Hopkins Watch.</span> The mainspring barrel <i>E</i>, of a very large diameter in proportion to the diameter of the watch, occupies nearly the full diameter of the movement. The spring itself, narrower and much longer than usual, is made in the patent model by riveting two ordinary springs together end to end. Over this barrel and attached to the stationary frame of the watch is placed a large thin ring A, cut on its inner diameter with 120 teeth. Near its edge the barrel E carries a stud <i>g</i> on which runs a pinion of 10 in mesh with the ring gear <i>A</i>. On this pinion is a wheel of 80 driving a pinion of 6 on the escape-wheel arbor. The 15-tooth escape wheel locks on a spring detent and gives impulse to the balance in one direction only, being a conventional chronometer escapement. The intermediate wheel and pinion, balance wheel, and balance cock have been adapted from a Swiss bar movement of the time.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The second fault is in the ratio between the time of
one revolution and the number of revolutions necessary
for a day&#8217;s run. Three turns of the spring are,
of course, required to run the watch for an hour, since
the barrel and train revolve three times in that length
of time. If we choose to have the watch run for 30
hours on a winding, and this leaves but a small safety
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
factor, then we see that this will require 90 turns of
the main spring, a manifest impossibility in view of
the space available.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>

Probably no attempt was made to produce a
finished and practical watch at this time, although
Hopkins, the inventor, was an actual watchmaker as
well as a retail jeweler, with premises virtually in the
shadow of the Patent Office. He was a native of
Maine<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and had been established in Washington
since 1863, or perhaps some time in 1862.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

<h2>Developing the Invention</h2>

</div>

<p>
Edward A. Locke had long been seeking a simple
watch adapted to easy manufacture and a selling price
of three to four dollars. While on a trip to Washington
his attention was drawn to the Hopkins watch by
William D. Colt of Washington.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A result of this
meeting appears to have been the issuance to Jason
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
R. Hopkins of two patents,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in both of which half
rights were assigned to William D. Colt. Patent
165831, relates to a barrel arbor for watches. The
arbor will be seen (fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_4">4</a>) to consist of two parts, one
telescoped within the other and the composite arbor
<i>B</i>-<i>C</i> supported at each end by the frame of the watch.
The patent text limits itself to a bare description of
the arbor. In the light of what we have seen of the
shortcomings of the original model, however, the
patent drawings tell that much more had been accomplished
on the general design of a more workable
rotary watch.
</p>
<p>
A square on arbor <i>C</i> at the back of the watch permits
winding the main spring, which attaches to the
largest diameter of <i>C</i>, a ratchet or winding click being
supplied just under support <i>F</i>. The inner or front
part <i>B</i> of the composite arbor projects from the front
of the movement and revolves at the speed of the
barrel arbor, which speed is not specified. Also,
looking at the perspective view, we see that while the
chronometer escapement has been retained, the
balance has been placed eccentrically to make room
for the center arbor. The balance now describes an
orbit around the center of revolution. No driving
train is shown, it being irrelevant to the patent, but
there seems to be ample room for two intermediate
wheels and their pinions between the escape wheel
and the train cock boss, seen at the upper right in the
perspective view of figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_4">4</a>. Adding one more wheel
and pinion to the train would have the effect of
reducing the number of revolutions required of the
spring barrel. We have seen from examination of the
patent model of the Hopkins rotary that this was
necessary not only to reduce the number of turns of
the main spring and barrel but also to reduce the
force transmitted to the escapement. There seems
little reason from the foregoing observations and considerations
to doubt that these modifications had been
realized by the time of this patent. Again no dial gearing
is shown. If the need for special gearing existed
at this time it seems strange that it was not covered by
patent as was done in the later patent<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> assigned
to William B. Fowle. The only way to avoid special
gearing would be to revolve the barrel and train each
hour so that the minute hand could travel with them
as it travels with the center wheel in conventional
watches. Once this condition was set up, the usual
dial gearing would apply.
</p>
<p>
Companion patent 165830 (see fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_5">5</a>) covers a
mechanism to prevent overbanking of the balance
wheel, primarily of a chronometer escapement. This,
of course, was aimed at making it possible to use the
escapement in connection with a mainspring of
greatly varying power. We have seen that this condition
of uneven power existed in the first Hopkins
watch. While the condition was greatly improved in
the second model (seen in fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_4">4</a>), it was surely present
to some extent, as it is associated with every spring.
Overbanking protection may well have continued to
be necessary, particularly if the gear ratio between
escapement and barrel was low enough to permit
hourly rotation of the barrel. The features covered
by this patent were originally submitted as part of
what later became patent 165831. Examination of
the original manuscript patent file<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> shows that the
patent application was separated into two on the
suggestion of the patent examiner, who pointed out
that two distinct and separate mechanisms were
involved, either of which could be used without the
other.

<p>
These two patents, which actually started out as one,
appear to represent the watch as it was when Hopkins
went to Waterbury, Connecticut, where he again met
Edward A. Locke. They submitted this improved
watch model to the Benedict and Burnham Manufacturing
Co., which advised not manufacturing it
until it was further developed. Hopkins went with
his watch from there to Boston, where he conferred
with George Merritt who, like Locke, was interested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
in getting into the manufacture of a low-priced watch.
Merritt may have been the senior member of the
Locke-Merritt team or may simply have had more
faith than his associates in Hopkins and his watch.
At any rate, he advanced expense money while further
efforts at improvement were made.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Hopkins&#8217;
absence from the <i>Washington city directory</i> of 1877
is perhaps explained by this work he was doing on his
patent. While this was completed to Hopkins&#8217; satisfaction,
it still fell short of Merritt&#8217;s idea of practicality,
and the latter abandoned the idea of manufacturing
the watch;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> what had started out as a very simple
watch of few parts grew, with every effort to make it
workable, more and more complicated by involved and
expensive detail. It appears that Hopkins did not
possess the rare gift of improvement by simplification.
This is a rare gift, and one seldom possessed by an
individual very closely and intensely involved in the
minute details of a given problem.

<p>
How long this period of development and experimentation
required is unreported. It could hardly
have started before early June of 1875, when application
was made for the patent (165830) to prevent
overbanking. The cash book of William B. Fowle of
Auburndale, Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> tells us that he bought
half of William D. Colt&#8217;s half-interest in the Hopkins
rotary in March 1876, partly for cash but including a
royalty on each watch made. Half this royalty was
to go to Hopkins, a quarter to William D. Colt, and
a quarter to William B. Fowle. Does patent 179019,
issued June 20, 1876, to Hopkins, who assigned it on
June 10, 1876, to Fowle,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> represent the last improvement
offered to Merritt? It covers a device actuated
by a spur on a balance staff to lock the detent against
tripping when in one position and to permit normal
operation of the chronometer escapement when in
the other position (see fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_6">6</a>). Another patent applied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
for on January 12, 1876, was in prospect and finally
issued as no. 186838 on January 30, 1877, assigned to
William B. Fowle on November 21, 1876.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This is
much the most practical and useful patent in the
series. A comparison of these (see figs. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_7">7</a>
and <a href="#LN_FIGURE_8">8</a>) with
the Auburndale rotary watch (see fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_9">9</a>) shows a
remarkable similarity between the inventor&#8217;s conception
and the product eventually manufactured. A
practical center arbor to support and guide the entire
rotating mechanism is here combined with a stem-winding
and lever-setting mechanism and dial gearing
in a well thought out arrangement.

Here, where the story of the Hopkins watch diverges
from the interests who later brought out the rival
Waterbury watch, it seems appropriate to call the
reader&#8217;s attention to the basic points of novelty and
merit in the Hopkins watch which carried over to
what became the Waterbury, somewhat as an
hereditary characteristic passes from generation to
generation. Previous writers have realized that one
of these watches led to the other and have grouped
them together because of the rotating feature which
they shared in common. Beyond this point they have
treated the watches as though they had nothing in
common. Actually several basic features of the Hopkins
watch existed in both: the long narrow spring in
a barrel approximately filling one side of the watch
case, a train rotating in the center of the watch and
driven by a planetary pinion in mesh with a gear
fixed to the stationary part of the watch, a slow beat
escapement, and probably the hourly rotation of the
train and escapement. When these details appeared
in the first watches manufactured for Messrs. Locke
and Merritt by the Benedict and Burnham Manufacturing
Co. and later the Waterbury Watch Co.,
they were vastly changed in detail and much
better adapted to mass production, although still
basically the same.

The story of Hopkins&#8217; rotary watch now enters an
entirely new setting with new financial backing which,
however, had no apparent experience or background
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
in mechanical work, much less watch manufacturing.
Those with watchmaking experience who were
brought into this new organization unquestionably
did their best, based on past experience confined to
conventional watches of much higher grade. Judging
from the products turned out, however, they had great
difficulty in making a clean break with their past and
in producing a satisfactory low-priced watch of new
and radical concept. The market for watches, which
had been depressed, was at this time reviving a little.

William Bentley Fowle (fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_10">10</a>), new partner with
Hopkins and Colt in the watch, was born in Boston,
Massachusetts on July 27, 1826. His father, William
B. Fowle, Senior, a well-known Boston teacher and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
educator, had variously been a bookseller and conductor
of a &#8220;Female Monitorial School.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The
junior William B. Fowle we have first located as a
ticket master with the Boston and Worcester Railroad
in 1848,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and he retained this listing in the directory
through 1851. Starting in 1852 and continuing
through 1862, with no indication of employer or
occupation, he had an office at 9 Merchants Exchange.
In 1860 and 1862 he was a member of the Boston
Common Council, and was president of that body in
1865. In 1862, after the second battle of Bull Run,
he raised an infantry company for the 43rd Massachusetts
Volunteers and was mustered in, September
24, 1862, with the rank of captain. From December
7, 1862, to March 4, 1863, he was commandant of the
military post at Beaufort, North Carolina. He then
reported to his regiment. On June 24, 1863, he was
left sick at New Bern, North Carolina, by his company
bound for Fortress Monroe. On July 21 he rejoined
his company at Boston, Massachusetts, in time to be
mustered out on July 30 at the expiration of his nine
months&#8217; enlistment.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>

In the 1864 <i>Boston directory</i> we find him listed as
treasurer of the Bear Valley Coal Co., and the
North Mountain Coal Co., with an office at 38 City
Exchange. This association with the coal business
continued with changes unimportant to our story
through the directories until 1877, in which year the
name is dropped from the <i>Boston directory</i>, not to reappear
until the directory of 1880, where he is listed
at &#8220;Herald Building, watches and timers.&#8221; This
was apparently the sales office. The <i>Newton directory</i>

<p>
William Atherton Wales of New York is credited
with introducing Mr. Fowle to the Hopkins watch.
No clue has come to light on what connection there
was between Hopkins and Wales, who had been a
partner in the large watch-importing house of Giles,
Wales and Co., in New York and later a large stockholder
in the United States Watch Co. of Marion,
New Jersey, which had only ceased operation in 1874.
A patent<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> had been issued to Fayette S. Giles of
New York, the leading figure in the United States
Watch Co., for an improvement in stem-winding
watches. This had presumably been available to
his company. In this winding mechanism a crown
pinion driven by a clutch on the stem engages with
a large ring gear, having 110 internal teeth, which in
turn drives a gear on the barrel arbor. The author
has seen no watch, except the patent model,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> containing
this device, but the pillar plate of many of
the United States Watch Co. movements were cut
out, apparently to receive this ring gear.
</p>
<p>
The expense of cutting so many internal teeth in
steel seems reason enough to explain why this patent
did not become the basis for all their stem-wound
models. Steel is far more difficult to cut than brass,
resulting in a much greater consumption of time and
cutters, both of which represent money to the manufacturer.
In the patent model these ring-gear teeth
have been cut by a milling cutter which did not pass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
through the ring and across the face of the teeth. This
produced a gear somewhat resembling an internal
bevel gear, one which could have only the merest
contact with its mating pinion. To make a durable
gear for this application it would be necessary to pass
the cutter through the ring in line with the gear axis.
This would require a special or, at least, radically
modified gear-cutting machine with a cutter arbor
shorter than the inside diameter of the gear. Into
this short space the spindle bearings and means of
driving the spindle would have to be crowded, along
with the cutter. Hopkins faced a problem similar to
this in cutting the ring gear for his watch, except that
the brass gear needed for the rotary watch could be
cut far more easily and quickly. This may be the link
which brought Wales and the defunct United States
Watch Co. into the Auburndale picture. Another
plausible link between Fowle and Wales involves a
patent<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Wales received for a pulley. This, the now
familiar device of interlocking conical sections so
commonly used in variable speed
<span style="font-family: sans-serif">V</span>-belt
drives, was
assigned to G. E. Lincoln of Boston, Massachusetts.
George E. Lincoln was treasurer of the Mammoth
Vein Consolidated Coal Co. at Boston in 1865, with
an office adjoining that of Fowle. In addition he
boarded for many years at Auburndale,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and he
apparently owned the buildings about to be converted
into a watch factory. Thus we see that Lincoln may
very well have been the one who brought Fowle and
Wales together.

stories high and measuring 40 x 20 and 32 x 20 feet,
respectively, were located on the Weston bank of the
Charles River, opposite Fowle&#8217;s home, from which
they could be reached by a private ferry. This
pleasant bucolic location was not far upstream from
that originally sought by the Boston Watch Co. when
that firm was looking for a spot to move to from
Roxbury in 1854. The situation of the factory was

This idyllic pastoral setting surely must have been a
joy to all connected with the little watch factory. It
seems to typify the atmosphere of wealth and leisure
into which the infant industry was brought without
adequate study of the problems it would be called
upon to surmount.
</p>
<p>
The Auburndale machinery came from the United
States Watch Co. factory at Marion, New Jersey,
which, as we have seen, was closed in 1874. William
A. Wales, who was associated with Fowle in the Auburndale
&#8220;adventure,&#8221; had been secretary, treasurer,
and director of this company. Most of the machinery
came from George E. Hart and Co., of Newark, which
had taken over much of the Company&#8217;s equipment,
eventually selling it to other factories. Warren E.
Ray, a neighbor of Mr. Fowle&#8217;s, commenced as manager
of the factory in July 1876, and died suddenly of
heart disease about October 1 of that year. He was
soon succeeded by Mr. James H. Gerry, who had gone
from Waltham to Newark in 1863 to superintend the
building of the original machines for the United States
factory.
</p>
<p>
The employees were chiefly drawn from other factories,
principally the neighboring American Watch
Co. at Waltham, and the defunct United States Watch
Co., while some who needed no specific watchmaking
skills perhaps never had worked in a watch factory before.
Names, not already mentioned, that have been
preserved are: George H. Bourne, L. C. Brown, Abraham
Craig, Frederick H. Eaves, Henry B. Fowle, Benjamin
F. Gerry, William H. Guest, Jose Guinan, Sadie
Hewes, Isaac Kilduff (the watchman), Justin Hinds,
E. Moebus, James O&#8217;Connell (the stationary engineer),
Edwin H. Perry, Frank N. Robbins, John Rose,
Thomas W. Shephard, William H. A. Simmons, Alfred
Simpson, Thomas Steele, Oscar L. Strout, and
George Wood. These, compiled from several sources,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
represent only a few of the men who contributed their
knowledge and skill to the enterprise; they are listed
in alphabetical order because it has been found impossible
to arrange them accurately according to position,
magnitude of contribution, or length of service.
</p>
<p>
Of the five Hopkins patents<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the first and the last
are the ones covering the essential elements used in
the Auburndale product. The two patents assigned
in half to William D. Colt apparently were never used,
nor does the device shown in figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_6">6</a> seem to have
been used, although these unused patents are listed on
the Auburndale movements. Now that the watch was
in the hands of men accustomed to making watches,
some modifications dictated by their experience and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
by considerations of expediency in manufacture were
made. The movement that issued was 18 size, rather
thick, cased at the factory in a nickel case made by the
Thiery Watch Case Co. of Boston, Massachusetts.
In the winding and setting mechanisms, some changes
in details were made with respect to those shown in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_7">7</a>. The dial is mounted by means of a rim
which snaps over the edge of the movement as on a
high-grade Swiss watch of the same era. The usual
dial feet, if used, would have interfered with the rotation
of the movement. For the same reason, of
course, there is no dial indicating seconds.

<p>
Five jewels are found in most instances, two cap
jewels and two hole jewels for the balance staff and a
jeweled impulse pin. One of the faults of the movement
is that the cap and hole jewels on the balance are
not separable for cleaning. After the jewels were inserted
part of the setting was spun down over them,
making the assembly permanent. A few movements
with only one jewel are known, the cap and hole
jewels being metal &#8220;jewels&#8221; likewise set under a spun-over
rim. Whether or not the impulse jewel found in
these last-mentioned movements is original or a later
intrusion remains undetermined. It is easy to conceive
that the factory would see no more necessity for
an impulse jewel than for other jewels.
</p>
<p>
The lever escapement is the only one known to have
been used, but two varieties of this are found (see
fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_11">11</a>). One is a standard club-tooth lever with
banking pins, the other, much more interesting because
unconventional, has pointed pallets and all the lift
on the escape wheel, which has very short stubby
teeth, very much like the wheel of a pin-pallet escapement.
No banking pins are used, the banking taking
place between the pallets and the wheel. An examination
of a number of these watches, with serial
numbers ranging from 46 to 507,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> reveals no correlation
between the serial number and the style of
escapement, from which one may conclude that the
pointed pallet escapement was originally used; later
four balance jewels were added and the escapement
changed to the conventional club-tooth pattern. As
complaints came in about the defective running of
the watch these changes were apparently substituted
at the factory in customers&#8217; watches. The movements
with the pointed-pallet escapement seldom show much
wear; on the other hand, watch no. 224,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> which has
the conventional escapement and five jewels, is very
much worn and must have run for many years.
</p>
<p>
These watches are stem wound by turning opposite
to the usual direction and are set through the winding
crown after actuating a setting lever located under
the front bezel. The plates, bridges, and ring gear
are nickel-plated and highly buffed, making a very
showy movement, the only instances of such a finish
on watches in the author&#8217;s experience. In figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_12">12</a>
is shown a 24-hour dial to fit the movement. Special
dial gearing would be required for the hour hand to
accompany this dial.

<p>
The first of these watches were placed on the market
in 1877, priced at $10.00 to the trade. Soon complaints
came in that they were defective in operation
and many were returned. We have seen from the
specimens examined that there seems to have been
no established model produced in quantity. The dial
and the number of jewels varied, as well as the escapement,
suggesting that the owners were groping for a
salable variant of the design for which they had tooled
the factory. Probably the pointed pallet escapement
was used first, it being the less expensive of the two.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
In addition to the saving effected by not requiring
banking pins, the escape wheel was much cheaper to
cut, as the teeth were very short and strong (see fig.
<a href="#LN_FIGURE_11">11</a>). Since the banking took place between the pallets
and the escape wheel, there was no adjustment for
the amount of slide; and since the watches were not
made to close tolerances, the slide was necessarily
excessive and consequently power consuming. The
conventional club-tooth escapement was probably
substituted as less troublesome, although the banking
pins were fixed and could only be adjusted by bending
them. The pallets remained solid steel, without
adjustable stone inserts.
</p>
<p>
At this stage of affairs approximately $140,000 had
been invested in the venture, the market was already
glutted with conventional watches which enjoyed
the confidence of retailers, and the Auburndale
Rotary had won a bad reputation. The success of
any watch depends largely on the confidence the
retail dealers have in it. They are looking for a
product easy to sell at an attractive profit as well as
one that will stay sold and create a satisfied customer.
Fowle was of course very much disappointed; before
going into the venture he had been advised that he
could expect to produce 200 watches per day on an
expenditure of $16,000.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The watches reached the
market at a time, the fall of 1877, almost coincidental
with application by D. Azro A. Buck for patents
on what was to become the Waterbury rotary.
These patents represented a new and economically
sound expression of the basic ideas of Hopkins. The
Waterbury associates immediately commenced work
aimed at getting their watch on the market by June
1878.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> News of this certainly reached Auburndale
where they were not only well aware of the cost of
producing their rotary but were also aware of the
strict cost and performance studies which Locke
and Merritt would apply to any watch before they
would invest in it. Knowledge of this very able
and well organized rival, coupled with the troubles
experienced in manufacturing and selling the Auburndale
Rotary, seem to account for the decision
to abandon it. It was unfortunate that the timing
of events happened just as it did for a little more
work on the Auburndale and the tools for making it
would probably have placed it on a firm footing in
the trade, although obviously it could never compete
with what eventually became the low-priced watch,
really a scaled-down alarm clock minus the alarm
mechanism.
</p>
<p>
It is said that about one thousand of the &#8220;Rotaries&#8221;
were made. The highest serial number to come to
the author&#8217;s attention, 507, may indicate that only
a part of the watches started were finished.
</p>
<p>
Accounts agree<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that the next product of the
factory was a &#8220;Timer&#8221; containing a novel escapement
patented on May 28, 1878,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> by William A.
Wales. Early specimens are marked &#8220;Pat. Applied
For,&#8221; but one with the serial number 996<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> bears
no reference at all to a patent, presumably because
issuance of the patent or patents was imminent.
Apparently the timer was in full production before
the patent was issued on May 28. Specimens with
higher serial numbers are stamped with three patent
dates, May 28, 1878,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> June 24, 1879, and September
30, 1879, as seen in figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_13">13</a>, which also shows the
arrangement of the train. In this escapement the
escape wheel (fig. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_14">14</a>) carries in the rim any suitable
number of steel pins all on the same radius from,
and parallel to, the axis of wheel rotation. In all
cases the wheel makes one revolution per second.
The verge (figs. <a href="#LN_FIGURE_14">14</a>
and <a href="#LN_FIGURE_15">15</a>) is so proportioned that
the distance between the points of repose on the
entrance and exit pallets will stop the wheel at
intervals equal to half the angular distance between
the pins.
</p>
<p>
In other words, with two pins in the escape wheel
the escapement will beat quarters of a second, because
starting from a point of repose the wheel will be arrested
on the other point of repose after turning
through 90°. With four pins in the escape wheel and
a suitably proportioned verge the escape wheel advances
in steps of 45° and beats eighths of a second.
The growing trend in this period to standardize the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
timing of sporting events in intervals of fifths of a second
is reflected in still another model having five pins
in the escape wheel and beating tenths of a second.
By the nature of the verge in this escapement, it will be
seen that the number of beats must be twice the number
of pins in the escape wheel, leaving no way to secure
an odd number of beats per second, hence the
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>-second
model. This must have been a less desirable
form because of the much smaller verge required,
plus the problem of accelerating so much mass from a
dead stop 600 times per minute.

Figure 17.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Timer Dial</span> that is probably either experimental or very early. Note that the fractions of a second (quarters) are shown on the outside dial instead of on a separate dial. This dial was converted at the factory for use as the base of a hairspring vibrating stand. A dial different from this but having the same arrangement of circles is known. (In author&#8217;s collection.)<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 16 illustrates a dial for this
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>-second
model
which the author found in a lot of unused parts left
over when the factory closed. The watch had an
18-size
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-plate
movement with grained nickel finish.
The escapement is special, as we have seen, but the
fork, roller, and balance action are conventional.
There are five jewels, four to support the balance staff
and an impulse jewel. The barrel arbor comes
through the top plate with a square, as in a keywind
watch, but is fitted with a winding handle, so that a
key is unnecessary. This handle appears to be an
afterthought, because on the earlier models (those with
serial numbers below 1,000), the barrel arbor is short,
barely long enough to attach the winding handle;
later this arbor was made longer. Patent 204274
issued to Benjamin Wormelle of Brighton, Massachusetts,
on May 28, 1878, the same date as Wales&#8217; escapement
patent, may have suggested this winding
handle. On watches with higher serial numbers,
there are two arrows on the handle to show the direction
to wind.
</p>
<p>
The earliest of these timers had a slide on the side of
the case to stop the movement by means of a piece of
thin spring steel applied roughly tangentially to the
smooth rim of the three-arm, solid steel balance wheel.
When this action is reversed to start the movement,
the spring, in retracting from the wheel rim, starts the
wheel swinging. Soon this slide on the case was dispensed
with by fitting a curved sheet-metal rack into a
groove turned in the edge of the balance cock. Engaging
this rack was a pinion with a square hole
through which the square stem could slide to set the
hands back to zero as it had from the beginning, while
turning the stem now would actuate the pinion and
rack to start and stop the movement, as the slide in
the case had originally done.
</p>
<p>
Various minor changes, dictated by experience and
the need for economy in manufacture, were made in
these movements. After about the first thousand
the diameter of the balance was reduced from approximately .700
to about .530 inch. This smaller
wheel was, of course, much more suitable to vibrate at
the faster speeds required on the models beating eighths
and tenths of a second. At some time between the
manufacture of watches bearing serial numbers 3135
and 3622, the formerly separate winding pawl and
spring were combined into one piece that could be
entirely made in a punch press. Another economy
move was to stamp the name and patents in place of
hand engraving. For a long time hand engraving was
used, although stamping had been used from the
beginning on the earlier rotary watch.
</p>
<p>
The case was very similar to that used on the rotary.
The dial, of white enamel with snap rim fastened by a
screw,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> carried three graduated circles, an outer
circle graduated in seconds up to sixty surrounding
two smaller subsidiary dials. The top one of these
smaller dials recorded minutes elasped up to ten and
the lower one recorded fractions of a second. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
same dial was used on movements indicating quarters
and eighths of seconds, all being graduated in eighths.
A dial without provision for indicating the fractions of
a second on a separate small dial may be seen in
figure <a href="#LN_FIGURE_17">17</a>. This last has been made into a stand for
hair spring work and is shown with balance and spring
just as it came from the Auburndale factory with
balance spring and wheel for a timer still in place.

The sweep second hand and the minute register
hand are attached to heart-shaped cams friction
driven from their respective staffs. They are reset by
a bar pivoted beneath the dial and actuated by the
stem through pressure on the crown. An original

Figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_19">19</a> shows the mechanism of the split-second
model as represented in U.&nbsp;S. patent 220195 of
September 30, 1879, issued to William A. Wales and
assigned to William B. Fowle.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> A split-second mechanism
is used to time the finish of two horses in the
same race or any other similar event. In usual
watches of this nature the watch will run along
indefinitely with the extra or split second hand
stopped although this hand will not record more than
a difference of one minute from the main sweep hand.
This was not true of the Auburndale, as pointed
out in the instructions. The reason for this is that
motion is conveyed to this hand through a hair spring
which would be damaged if allowed to overwind. To
prevent this a stop is interposed which will halt the
entire watch unless directions are followed. The
serrated wheel <i>F</i>, of hardened steel, driving the second
sweep hand, is cut on the edge with 120 serrations;
stopping of this hand therefore is only to the nearest
half second regardless of how minutely the escapement
is dividing time. This is rather a serious defect as,
if timing a horse race as an example, the time of the
fastest horse is taken on this hand which registers a
lesser degree of accuracy than the time recorded on
the second and less important horse. A general view
of one of these watches is seen in figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_20">20</a>.

<h2>Success and Failure</h2>

<p>
It would be pleasant to report that after the fiasco
of the rotary model these timers were a financial
success, but the facts indicate otherwise. They were
well built and reliable, so that the trade was pleased
to stock and promote them. The public responded
well when in the market for a timer, as might be
expected, since no other stop watch with fractional
second dial or split-second hand was made in the
country. Those imported from abroad were many
times as expensive. Unfortunately the demand was
seasonal. Sometimes, during the racing season,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
demand would reach 400 per month, while at other
seasons of the year practically none at all were sold.
Some remained in stock during the remaining life of
the company, as is shown by the following advertisement,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
which was accompanied by an illustration of
the watch:

The old reliable Auburndale Chronograph Timers, for
sale by Edward H. Brown, No. 16 Maiden Lane, New York.
The manufacture of these watches having been discontinued
for reasons entirely apart from their value and reliability,
the stock in existence is very limited, and is now in the hands
of Mr. Edward H. Brown, No. 16 Maiden Lane, New York
City, the well known and reliable dealer in Watches,
Diamonds and Jewelry. The Auburndale timer has been
in the hands of a number of competent judges, and has
always been found to be accurate. It is of convenient size,
and is contained in a German silver case, nickel plated.
The timers are manufactured in two qualities, without split

have minute, second and lightning hands. We recommend

</p>
<p>
A steadier market was sought with the introduction
of a low priced
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-plate,
back-setting, 18-size watch to
compete, it was hoped, with the full-plate watches of
similar price made by the established companies.
Nearly all these watches had seven jewels, some few
had more. The majority were key wind and set with
a folding winding key permanently attached to the
barrel arbor, as in figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_21">21</a>. These were named
&#8220;Lincoln&#8221; for Mr. Fowle&#8217;s son, Lincoln A. Fowle,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and had a solid steel balance with screws and the general
appearance of a compensated balance. A stem-wound,
lever-set edition of the same basic watch was
named &#8220;Bentley&#8221; for Bentley D. Fowle, another son.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
This had a cut bimetallic balance and higher finish.
Conventional gilt finish was used on both of these
models, although one isolated specimen found in factory
remainders<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> has a bright nickel finish comparable
with the rotary watch. These watches were designed
by Chauncey Hartwell,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> after J. H. Gerry
had removed to Lancaster, where the Lancaster
Watch Co., organized in August 1877, was attempting
to bring a line of watches onto the market although
beset by acute financial woes similar to those building
up at Auburndale. To return to our
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-plate
watches,
it may be said that they were well made for the price,
reliable, and successful from a manufacturing point of
view but could not be sold at a figure high enough to
return a profit on the manufacture.

Up to this time, about November 1, 1879, the
Auburndale Watch Co., had existed as a private company;
now it was incorporated with a book value of
$500,000, and William B. Fowle, who at this point had
invested about $250,000 (mostly unrecoverable) in the
enterprise, was elected president, and George H.
Bourne was elected secretary and treasurer.
</p>
<p>
After a quantity of these Lincoln and Bentley
watches had been manufactured<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and it had become
clear that they could not be attractively priced to the
trade, the company sought a product adapted to their
factory equipment for which a constant market could
be found. The product chosen was a line of metallic
thermometers.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Two patents, 240058 and 240059,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
were issued to William A. Wales, assignor to the
Auburndale Watch Co., of Weston, Massachusetts,
on April 12, 1881. Whether these patents represent
the first thermometers made at Auburndale or reflect
the result of experience gained in making conventional
models is not clear. The earliest evidence dating
the appearance of the thermometer is the 1881
<i>Boston directory</i> which appeared on July 1. This illustrates
the same model of thermometer seen in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_22">22</a>. The patents cover means of eliminating
springs of any sort from the mechanism, so that the
hand or dial pointer is entirely under the influence of
the fused bimetallic thermal strips. Manufacture of
the timers was carried along with thermometer manufacture
at first, but production of the timer was
finally dropped, as the stock on hand was constantly
increasing, and for a while the factory was at last
operated at a profit, on thermometers alone. These
were furnished in cases from 20 inches in diameter
down to the size of a ten cent piece, according to
the advertising.

Unfortunately Mr. Fowle had suffered so much loss
through the watch venture and from other investments
that he was forced to make an assignment of his
personal estate. The watch company, without his
support, was carrying too large a burden of debt to
be self-supporting. In the fall of 1883 a voluntary
assignment was made and the equipment was sold in
February 1884.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The <i>Newton directory</i> of 1885 lists
W. B. Fowle as a thermometer manufacturer on
Woodbine Street, &#8220;house near.&#8221; His home, &#8220;Tanglewood,&#8221;
was on Woodbine Street and perhaps the
thermometer business was operating in one of the
outbuildings. William A. Wales assigned to the
Auburndale Watch Co. patent 276101, of December
4, 1883, covering details of a unit counter for keeping
score in games, and for similar work. Among the
relics in the author&#8217;s collection is a box bearing the
label &#8220;Auburndale Counter, W. B. Fowle &amp; Son,
Auburndale, Mass.&#8221; These counters were packed
two in a box, the box just mentioned being suitable to
contain counters the size of the thermometer in figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_22">22</a>.
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_23">23</a> shows a larger counter measuring
4-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inches in diameter. From this and the fact that
Fowle as late as 1887, is carried in the <i>Newton
directory</i> as a manufacturer of metallic thermometers,
it seems that some attempt was made after dissolution
of the watch company to carry on manufacturing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
or perhaps only the assembly on a small scale of parts
previously manufactured. The <i>Directory</i> of 1889 lists
Fowle as an accountant on Ash Street, Auburndale.
He had bought this property in 1887, presumably
after disposing of &#8220;Tanglewood&#8221; which now would
be too large for his needs. In the editions of 1891 and
1893 he is listed as United States collector of internal
revenue, with an office at the Post Office building,
Boston. In 1895 he appears as an accountant at the
same address and from then to his death in 1902 he is
listed as an accountant at his home address in Auburndale.

Jason R. Hopkins, inventor of the first Auburndale
product, passed away in Washington late the same

<h2>The Lesson</h2>

</div>

<p>
The life of a pioneer has always been arduous. The
story we have just reviewed illustrates this. Hopkins
was a successful workman with clever and novel
ideas. Fowle had been very successful in an entirely
unrelated field. Wales had been very successful in
importing and selling watches but the watch factory
which he had owned in part had failed, the fault more
probably that of the times than of the man. The
various superintendents and foremen were first-class
men with ample background in making conventional
watches. At the time no one could have had experience
in manufacturing exactly the grade and
type of watch being attempted, for this was the
pioneer effort.

</div>

<p>
The country was in the grip of a long, lingering
depression following the Civil War. Money was
tight. The Auburndale Rotary was conceived as a
very low priced watch which would at the same time
include the desirable and unusual feature of close
timekeeping. Could these ideals have been adhered
to, there is little reason to question that it would have
found a market, even in hard times.
</p>
<p>
We have seen that every effort to improve the original
watch added to its cost, and here lies the real
reason why it failed to win acceptance. By the time
it reached the market it was no longer priced below
conventional watches and at least some specimens
were not reliable in performance. To make matters
even worse, the best features of Hopkins&#8217; rotary watch
had been incorporated by Locke and Merritt into a
competing rotary watch much better engineered for
cheap mass production.
</p>
<p>
At this point the only hope for the factory seemed
to be the manufacture of some other watch or similar
small mechanism. The Auburndale timer, with the
exception perhaps of the split-second model, was a
triumph mechanically and it returned a profit, but
not enough to meet the financial needs of its sponsors.
Much the same may be said of all the later Auburndale
products.
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>
The rotary had been of doubtful value when Flowe
bought it, and the new organization was not able to
contribute the necessary manufacturing engineering
to make it a successful product. By the time this
necessity was recognized, debts had mounted to the
point where later products, which might have been
successful on their own, were not able to carry the
burden. The whole affair can be viewed as a very
expensive educational adventure from which the
students were not able to salvage enough to put
their education to any use.
</p>
<p>
Surely they received a clear illustration of how
dangerous it can be to engage in an enterprise
without sufficient background or a long and careful
study of design, manufacturing processes, costs, and
market and sales analysis. For although numerous
fortunes have been made in watch manufacturing,
many more have been lost, and often those who
put every effort at their command into such ventures
came away with only sad experience as their reward.
Thus ended the story of the Auburndale Watch
Company.

Those who have seen the Waterbury watch, which developed
from this design, may be drawn to the conclusion that this explains
why it took so long to wind the Waterbury. Such is not
really the case; in the Waterbury the winding wheel (which is
on the outer rim of the barrel) was nearly as large as the inside
diameter of the case while the pinion engaging with it was of
only nominal diameter. This meant that one turn of the winding
crown wound the barrel a much smaller fraction of a
revolution than in a watch of conventional design.

Hopkins is not in the <i>Washington and Georgetown directory</i> of
1860 or 1862, and 1861 was not available to check. Starting
with 1863 he is listed each year through 1871. Starting with
1872 Boyd&#8217;s <i>Directory of the District of Columbia</i> lists Hopkins as
a resident each year (including 1902, the year of his death at
84 years) except 1877, when he was out of the city in connection
with the exploitation of his rotary watch patents. Carl W.
Drepperd, <i>American clocks and clockmakers</i> (Garden City, N.Y.,
1947), in referring to Hopkins, says, &#8220;Lincoln, Me. 1840&#8217;s-1850&#8217;s:
Bangor, Me., to 1862. Inventor of the Auburndale
Watch. Also manufactured pianos and clock cases.&#8221;

making in America,&#8221; <i>Jewelers Circular and Horological Review</i>,
January 1888, pp.&nbsp;400, 401. This history ran as a continuing
series of short articles appearing over a period of years. In his
sketch of the Waterbury Watch Co., Crossman gives the name
as William D. Coates, a name not found in Boyd&#8217;s <i>Directory of the
District of Columbia</i> for 1875. The directory does, however,
contain the name of William D. Colt, a patent attorney.

U.&nbsp;S. patent 204400. The text of this patent speaks of
dividing the second into &#8220;halves, quarters, eighths, etc.&#8221; and
in the summation of claims of &#8220;an escape wheel, <i>A</i>, provided
with one or more pairs of pins...&#8221; showing that measuring
tenths of a second with a five-pin escape wheel was not conceived
at this time. It is interesting to note that in referring
to the drawings shown in figure&nbsp;<a href="#LN_FIGURE_12">12</a> the text states &#8220;In the
present instance two pairs of pins are used to denote quarter
seconds.&#8221; Only one pair of pins is shown, which is correct.
This seems, however, to reflect carelessness on the part of
patent attorneys and examiners, as the error exists in the
original manuscript patent application preserved in the National
Archives, Washington, D. C.

Each model of watch made at Auburndale was numbered
in its own series, starting at number 1, contrary to the usual
watch factory practice where blocks of serial numbers are assigned
to different models. Other Auburndale products seem
not to have borne serial numbers.
